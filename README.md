# Weekday-Planner

## Description

- My motivation to building this project was to give the user an easily accessible method of planning out their day by incrementing one hour blocks. I built it in part to help myself, as I have a lot of events I need to have ordered throughout the day, but mostly to provide a easy to use planner. It solves the problem of mentally keeping track of events throughout the day.
